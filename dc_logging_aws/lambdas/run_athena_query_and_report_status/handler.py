    Supports both starting and then checking an Athena query.

    `QueryName` is the named query to run. The query gets the event dict
                as a template context

    `QueryString` if this is passed in, `QueryName` is ignored. Designed
                  to allow running ad-hox queries rather than saved queries.

    `QueryContext`: this is passed to the query and anything here can be used
               with `{foo}` template substitution.

    If `blocking` is passed then we run the Lambda until the query finished.

    If `queryExecutionId` is passed in, then we check for the status of a
    previously started query. This is used by AWS Step Functions to test if a
    long-running job has finished.
